## Whitman Poem Generator
![component model](./public/component-model.png)


### Description :
This is a small application to allow the user to get a random poem every time they click a button. I chose Walt Whitman because he's one of my favorite poets, but in the future, I would like to add several poets and give the user the ability to change authors using a dropdown UI.
